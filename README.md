# ALC-Challenge-Travelmantics
This is challenge 2 for the Andela Google Developer program 4.0. 
The challenge is to create an app using firebase that requires a login and shows different travel options. 
There is an admin access that allows the admin to make changes (add, delete, edit) and a customer access that does not allow these actions.
